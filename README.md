Brunch For Libs
===============

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/monokrome/brunch-for-libs.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is a project aimed at providing you the ability to use brunch for the
development of javascript libraries. Instead of building full-blown web
applications, this skeleton allows you to easily build tools for use in
your web applications.

By default, it takes every file in the *src* directory, and compiles them
into a *build* directory.
